Hello and welcome to the re-launch of my blog site.  My previous blog
was created using [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org "WordPress")
which, although a great blogging platform, is written in PHP.  I decided
that I wanted more control over my blog, so I've decided to switch to
using [SubText](http://www.subtextproject.com/) which is written in
.NET.  So far I've not had any need to modify anything though, I've just
created a theme based on [Andreas Viklund's](http://andreasviklund.com/)
template,
[Andreas09](http://andreasviklund.com/blog/webdesign/new-template-andreas09/).

This blog will contain mainly .NET related material, but I may post
other random stuff if I think it's interesting (to me, at least).  If
you do find something useful, or you need further information, please
leave a comment.

Thanks for visiting!
