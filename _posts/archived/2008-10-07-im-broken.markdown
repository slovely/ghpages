Unfortunately I suffered two broken bones in my hand whilst playing
football last week.  This means that my follow-on post about using
mixin's with DynamicProxy will have to wait for a few weeks as typing
causes my hand to ache quite quickly!  Fortunately it's only my left
hand, so I can just about manage most tasks!  I should be out of plaster
in 3-4 weeks from now - I hope anyway, as it is already driving me
crazy!
