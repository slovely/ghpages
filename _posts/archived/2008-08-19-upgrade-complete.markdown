As mentioned in my last post, I have upgraded my blog to the new version
of [SubText](http://www.subtextproject.com/) (v2).  It all went
reasonably well except for a few files which are still in the source
code repository, but are no longer included in the project.  Because of
the way I copied the files across to my local copy, I accidentally
included these old files in the project so I was getting a few build
errors.  Once that was sorted it all went well.

*Changes I like so far:*

-   The admin site certainly looks a lot more professional.
-   The enhanced Windows Live Writer support is very good.

I'm sure that there is a lot more than that but I posting this 10
minutes after the upgrade has completed so I haven't noticed yet!!
