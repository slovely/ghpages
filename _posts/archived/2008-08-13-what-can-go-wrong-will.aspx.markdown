Just a few days after I finally moved my blog over to
[SubText](http://wwww.subtextproject.com) 1.95, they released version
2.0!  Just typical!  In fairness, it looks like a straight forward
upgrade so I'll just get on and do it, but why couldn't it have been
released just BEFORE I started instead?!

If I run into any interesting problems upgrading I'm sure I'll post
about them here...
