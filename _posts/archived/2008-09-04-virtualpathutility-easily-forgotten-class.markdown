This post is really just to remind myself of a class that I always seem
to forget! 
[System.Web.VirtualPathUtility](http://msdn.microsoft.com/system.web.virtualpathutility)
is a static class that contains a multitude of methods to use on URLs. 
Everything from the simple 'AppendTrailingSlash' to the more
sophisticated 'ToApRelative'.  It's always worth a look at this class to
see if a method you need already exists, but because I don't need to
mess with URL's often, I forget it - hopefully this post will help keep
it in my mind!!
